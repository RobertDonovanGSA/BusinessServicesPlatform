The Kanban board consists of 2 major components; States and Swimlanes.





### States

States refer to the uniform steps that each user story, task, or requirement goes through from start to acceptance. 


####Example States


1. Backlog
2. Defined
3. In-Progress
4. Completed
5. Accepted

####Exit Agreement

The Exit Agreement is the agreement amongst the team members of the criteria that must be met in order for a work item to move to the next step in the workflow.


### Swimlanes

Swimlanes are a more conceptual element that revolves around how work is segmented, whether it be by functional group or priority.



#### Example Swimlanes

1. Expedited vs Not Expedited
2. Owner
