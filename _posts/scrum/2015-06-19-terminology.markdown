|     ScrumMaster      | Team leader responsible to help the team communicate and collaborate, to protect the team, to remove impediments, to mature the team, to coordinate outside the team, and to guide the team in following agile practices and principles. |
|      User Story      | A system requirement written from the point of view of the user or customer. Typically follows the format: “As a <who>, I want <want functionality> because <why>.” Roughly equates to a System Change Request (SCR). |
