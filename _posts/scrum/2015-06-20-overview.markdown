    This is version 1 of the SDLC.

As we move towards providing real-time performance analytics to our leadership to help drive better IT decisions, it is imperative that we begin to standardize processes around how we manage Agile projects.

This "SDLC" provides guidance to the entire TSD division on how the division operates in an "agile" environment. It covers the overall development lifecycle as well as standard operating proceedures for dealing with common issues that projects managers new to Agile Scrum tend to encounter.

It is an important objective of this guidance to be Agile in its own manner. This guidance is open to feedback and will be revised as our organization matures in its ability to manage agile projects.
